   <blockquote><em>“Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its
   life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and in the process heal our own - indeed to
   embrace the whole of creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. Recognizing that sustainable development,
   democracy and peace are indivisible is an idea whose time has come”
